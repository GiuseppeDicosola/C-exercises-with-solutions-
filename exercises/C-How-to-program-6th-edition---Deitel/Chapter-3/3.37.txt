(How Fast is Your Computer?) How can you determine how fast your own computer really
operates? Write a program with a while loop that counts from 1 to 300,000,000 by 1s. Every time
the count reaches a multiple of 100,000,000, print that number on the screen. Use your watch to
time how long each 100 million repetitions of the loop takes.
